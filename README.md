# 📧 Spam Mail Detection using BERT

This project uses a **BERT-based NLP model** to classify emails as **spam** or **not spam** with high accuracy. By leveraging transformer-based models like `facebook/bart-large-mnli`, this solution enhances spam detection using **zero-shot classification** and deep contextual understanding of email content.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ BERT-based model using HuggingFace Transformers (`facebook/bart-large-mnli`)
- ✅ Supports zero-shot classification for better adaptability
- ✅ Advanced text preprocessing for cleaner input
- ✅ Plans for API integration and feature expansion
- ✅ Easily extendable with additional metadata (sender, subject, etc.)

## 🧠 Model Details

- **Model Used**: `facebook/bart-large-mnli` from HuggingFace
- **Approach**: Zero-shot classification
- **Why BERT?**: It enables context-aware classification and can handle unseen spam formats without retraining.
